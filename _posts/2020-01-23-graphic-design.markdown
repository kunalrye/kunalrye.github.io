## How I started

Graphic design is something that I have taken from ideation to fruition, multiple times starting in high school. Design has always interested me, beginning with my introduction to Google's material design update when I had an android. Seeing firsthand how the design itself of the OS affected the user experience drew me in. From there, I started to pickup Photoshop and redesigned my robotics program logos and STEM program's website in high school. Since then, I have cultivated my interest by further developing my design skills through more projects and learning more about the field continually.
