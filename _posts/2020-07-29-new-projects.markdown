## Work in Progress
Turns out sometimes you start things that don't go anywhere or sometimes you get beat to market :anguished:.
Anyway, it is still a fun journey. Some recent projects I worked on were unlucky, and I decided to take a break from those to explore new paths.

I am currently working on a couple of projects for my own interest.
One of them is improving my music selection on Spotify because I got tired of Discover Weekly and Release Radar and could not get good recommendations from their song radio feature. :dancer:

Another is looking at the intersections of politically divisive hashtags :collision: or hashtags that are commonly associated with one view or another. I am just trying to get a feel for what kind of discussion is created if at all.
