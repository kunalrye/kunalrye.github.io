## Past Case Studies

Uber APM Assignment 2020: Really enjoyed creating this concept. It definitely would help improve the UberEats experience with regards to the tail end of the delivery. UberSpots and UberHubs are brand names I chose, but this could work just as well without them. Check it out [here](https://kunalrai.com/UberAssignment.pdf).

## Work in Progress
It turns out that sometimes you start things that do not go anywhere or sometimes you get beat to market. :anguished:
Regardless, it is still a fun journey. Some recent projects I worked on were unlucky, and I decided to take a break from those to explore new paths.

I am currently working on a couple of projects for my own interest.
One of them is improving my music selection on Spotify because I have gotten tired of Discover Weekly and Release Radar. I am also not satisfied with their song radio feature especially with respect to songs that are out of the artists typical genre. :dancer:

Another is looking at the intersections of politically divisive hashtags :collision: or hashtags that are commonly associated with a specific view. I am trying to get a feel for what kind of discussion is created if at all from these tweets or from using certain hashtags.
