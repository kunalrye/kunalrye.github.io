## Creating a standalone tool
My first project at LM Aeronautics was to develop a standalone tool that created a value for software changes that were made to the F-35. I had to take a set of software changes that had been assigned monetary value and determine how to predict the value that a new software update would provide. Since this software was related to the performance of a physical fighter jet, there were quite a few variables to consider. 

### Process
In order to predict, I had to understand the data first. I took a period to understand the factors, meet with SME's who provided data, and pre-process the data before developing the tool. 

### Development
Due to software constraints, I had to open myself to new development options. Given that the tool needed to be portable and the output easily understandable for presentation, I decided to pickup Visual Basic for Applications and develop in a spreadsheet. It was very different coming from Python but I was able to learn quite a bit about the limitations and benefits of my choice. Ultimately, the tool was simple and fast, while producing predictions of value within 15% of the actual value.
