## Project 1: Granola / Protein Brand

As someone allergic to peanuts and treenuts, it is often difficult to find sweets, snacks, and other food items that I can eat, especially convenient food. I am working on developing the business case for a brand that will produce healthy food items for individuals allergic to peanuts and treenuts.

## Project 2: Investment Strategies and Decisions

With the money I make from internships and research, I invest. Whether it be stocks, ETF's, or mutual funds, I try to learn and maintain a balanced but not risk averse portfolio. As I am only 19, I believe that having a portfolio that has some low growth funds while also having decent exposure to more high yield high risk stocks is important. 

I try to keep up with current trends and news on industries I am following, and am learning more about financial statements and qualitative analysis for stock picking. 

This could translate to a new app in the future, keep your eyes peeled!
