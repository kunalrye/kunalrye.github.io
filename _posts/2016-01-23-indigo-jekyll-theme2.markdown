This is an ongoing project that I am working on with Professor Sachdeva at the Jones Graduate School of Business. 

# Learning about Pandas
Starting my research position with Professor Sachdeva was my introduction to data analysis and manipulation with Python. I quickly learned about Pandas, Spark, Linux, and the many tools available from those libraries/softwares. Working with large amounts of data and using dataframes to work with data gave me a easy visualization of how the data was stored and how to manipulate it. By testing and using stackoverflow to learn about how Pandas works, I was able to start data engineering the location data that was provided and manipulate it to be able to filter for specific things across multiple data sets. 

# Results and Takeaways
I am still working on this project so as progress is made, I will update this page with more content.
