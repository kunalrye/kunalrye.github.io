## How I started

Graphic design is something that I have taken from ideation to fruition, multiple times starting in high school. Design has always interested me, beginning with my introduction to Google's material design update when I had an android. Seeing firsthand how the design itself of the OS affected the user experience drew me in. From there, I started to pickup Photoshop and redesigned my robotics program logos and STEM program's website in high school. Since then, I have cultivated my interest by further developing my design skills through more projects and learning more about the field continually.

## My Portfolio
If you would like to check out some of the designs described below, feel free to check out my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/ksrai9914a6).

## IEEE Merchandise
I noticed that specific departments and clubs that were rather large, do not have a equivalent campus prescence due to their lack of marketing and representation at key events. This was especially an issue for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department as well as Rice's IEEE chapter. To increase campus prescence, I created Rice ECE merchandise, which net around $3k in sales and recieved orders from current students, professors, and alumni alike. 

## Parody Designs
At Rice, parody designs have taken over a significant amount of the residential college (dorm) merchandise scene. I took a liking to these designs and crafted some mock designs for Jones college merchandise using logos like Versace, North Face, and Nike. Beyond college merchandise, for Rice's Beer Bike event, I designed the shirts for the 2019 event, a take on Travis Scott's Astroworld, 'Smashtroworld'.


## Side Designs

Outside of larger groups I also design logos and images for fun or for newer clubs/groups. If you need something designed or have ideas for how I can improve my designs, feel free to let me [know!](ksr3@rice.edu)
