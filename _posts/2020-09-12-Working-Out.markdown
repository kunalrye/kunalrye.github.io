## How I am working towards my goals
This url contains my current training program that I have made based on my previous programs and my new goals.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSckwGxC1GmgVnEPD51P50_ReHOdond9IowU7ZO9SOlyYUl4Yrj8acD8RQEw2CFlDlyQo7BE_olqDmF/pubhtml?gid=1410560354&single=true

For the past year I have been focused on improving my flexibility with the end goal of being able to dunk. After working on that for a year, I have been able to dunk a volleyball but have begun to plateau. I am switching my program in order to break through this plateau I am in as well as develop in other areas that I neglected during this year. Working remotely this year has also made me realize the difference nutrition has made for me. Since quarantine, I have lost 10 pounds of mostly body fat that I did not recognize that I had. I have switched my diet up in order to maintain this new weight as well as reduce my body fat percentage slightly more.
