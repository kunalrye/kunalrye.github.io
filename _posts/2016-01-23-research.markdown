This is an ongoing project that I am working on with a Professor of Finance at the Jones Graduate School of Business.

# Learning about Pandas
Starting my research position was my introduction to data analysis and manipulation with Python. I quickly learned about Pandas, Spark, Linux, and the many tools available from those libraries/softwares. Working with large amounts of data was new to me and learning how to use dataframes to work with the data easily was among the first steps I took. Further the value of visualization of the data through libraries like seaborn and matplotlib gave me a better idea of what I was working with and what the next steps should be.

# Continual Work
Since I started research, I have skilled up significantly through research, my classes, and internships. From learning the basics of pandas I am now working with NLP techniques to look at corporate datasets for insights.
