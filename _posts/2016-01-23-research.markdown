This is an ongoing project that I am working on with a Professor of Finance at the Jones Graduate School of Business. 

# Learning about Pandas
Starting my research position with Professor Sachdeva was my introduction to data analysis and manipulation with Python. I quickly learned about Pandas, Spark, Linux, and the many tools available from those libraries/softwares. Working with large amounts of data was new to me and learning how to use dataframes to work with the data easily was among the first steps I took. Further the value of visualization of the data through libraries like seaborn and matplotlib gave me a better idea of what I was working with and what the next steps should be. By trial and error, and using stackoverflow to learn about the details of how Pandas works, I was able to start data engineering the location data that was provided and manipulate it to be able to filter for specific things across multiple data sets. 

# Results and Takeaways
I am still working on this project so as progress is made, I will update this page with more content.
