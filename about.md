# Hey! I'm Kunal

## A Bit About Me

<p>I am currently a senior at Rice studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Data Science along with a minor in Business.</p>
<p>Product has become a primary interest of mine through learning more about the field, as well as through having multiple product experiences that leave me unsatisfied. An example is I used to download 10 different apps for the function I was looking for and try them all out, sometimes I would find a gem but most of the time I would delete them all (A recommendation of an app that I think is a gem is Dark Sky, trust me I have tried them all).<p>
<p>Outside of university, I have a number of things I am working on including myself. I am currently on a journey to dunk (almost there!, I can dunk a volleyball on a 10ft hoop), increasing my cycling distance and average speed, reading some books on a variety of things, as well as cooking.<p>
