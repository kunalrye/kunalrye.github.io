<p>Hello, there! I'm Kunal Rai.</p>

<p>I am currently a junior at Rice studying Electrical Engineering with a focus in Data Science along with a minor in Business. I am the Vice President of Rice IEEE and a senior analyst at our undergraduate fund. I also do graphic design on the side, producing logos and images for various clubs and campus organizations.</p>
<p>My interests in both engineering and business carry over to my career interests as well. I am passionate about design, new technology, and leveraging data to solve business problems. These align with my interest in product management, data science, and consulting.<p>
<p>Outside of class and projects, I enjoy cycling, weightlifting, playing basketball, travelling, hiking, reading, and finding good places to eat. If you are looking for a good book / place to eat, or you have any recommendations, feel free to let me know!<p>
