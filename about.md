## About Me

<p>I am currently a senior at Rice studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Data Science along with a minor in Business.</p>
<p>Product has become a primary interest of mine through learning more about design, as well as being unsatisfied product experiences that I have had.<p>
<p>Outside of university, I have a number of things I am working on including myself. I am currently on a journey to dunk (almost there I can dunk a volleyball on a 10ft hoop), increasing my cycling distance and average speed, reading some books on a variety of things, as well as cooking.<p>
