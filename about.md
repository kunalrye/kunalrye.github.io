## A Bit About Me

<p>I am currently a senior at Rice studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Data Science along with a minor in Business.</p>
<p>Learning through experience has been a key driver in helping me find what is most interesting to me. I started college interested in business and computer science, two very broad fields with a large intersection. Through coursework, projects, and internships, I was able to whittle down my areas of interest, which led me to major in Electrical Engineering with a focus in data science.</p>
<p>Business started to connect after I focused down to data science. After taking a marketing class my sophomore year which opened my eyes to customer interaction and being customer focused, I realized where business clicked with data for me was in the product space. Understanding who the customer is, what we are building, how it is being built, and when it should be built are some key questions I became excited to think about.</p>
<p>When this clicked for me, I began to realize that I had been thinking about product a lot in the past. At one point a few years back I journeyed through every single weather app in the iOS and Android app stores, looking for the weather app that was actually useful. You would think a weather app is hard to mess up, but the time I spent testing them all proved that line of thought incorrect. (I ended up using Dark Sky if you were wondering which one is the best, also feel free to ask me why)</p>
<p>Outside of university, I have a number of things I spend my time on. I am currently trying to dunk on a 10ft hoop (almost there!, I can dunk a volleyball). Along with that I am working on increasing my average cycling speed to 18 mph over a distance of 15 miles, reading some books (currently reading Algorithms to Live By), as well as cooking.<p>
